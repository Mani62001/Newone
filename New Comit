# Introduction to Python
Python is introduced by Guido Van Russom in 1991.

Python is case sensitive language.

Python is general purpose high level programming language which supports OOPs and POPs

OOPs based upon classes and objects.
POPs based on fuctions, structure oriented
Syntax - It is a grammar for any programming language or it is a format that has to be followed while writing the code.
# Variables
Varaibles are containers which hold some data or value/information.

a=10

a  ---> variable
=  ---> Operator (Assignmnet operator)
10 ---> value/litreal
# Comments in Python - A piece of code which is not executable by the compiler. Denotion is '#'
# Rules to be followed while naming a varaible.

Rule 1. Keywords and inbuilt functions names are not allowed to use as a varaible name.

Keywords - These are some certain words which already have predefined meaning in python. eg, def, True, class, if

Inbuilt functions - A  block of code which has predefined task in python. eg, print(), range(), len(), type()

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2. Variable names can start with a letter or underscore(_) but never with number.
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)
# Operators
# Arithmetic operator - used to perform basic arithmetic operation.

a=10   # Addition
b=12
c=a+b
print(c)
a=5
b=7
print(a+b)
print(b-a)
print(b*a)
print(b/a)
a=9
b=2
print(a%b)   # Modulous
a=2
b=4
c=a**b    # Exponential
print(c)
a=5
b=7
print(b//a)  # floor division
# Comparison Operator - These are used to return a boolean value after the comparison i.e, True/False

# equal to (==)

a=10
b=10
print(a==b)
a=10
b=10
print(a!=b)
a = 4
b = 5
c= 4
print(a>b)
print(a<b)
print(a<=c)
print (a>=c)

# Assignmnet operator - These are used to assign values to a varaible.

a=10
print(a)
a+=1
print(a)
a+=1
print(a)
a-=1
print(a)
a*=2
print(a)
b=2
print(b)
b+=1
print(b)
x=10
print(x)
x=10
x+=1
print(x)
# Logical operator - are used to perform logical operations on boolean values. eg, include operators like 'AND', 'OR', 'NOT'

x=3
print(x>4 and x<5)     # here both the conditions must be true
x=3
print(x>4 or x<5)     # here any of the condition is true, will return true 
x=5
print(not(x>2 and x<10))  # here it will reverse the result, if we get true it will reverse to false
# Identity operator - These are used to compare identity of two objects.
# this operator includes 'is' and 'is not'


a=10
b=10
c=20

if a is b:
    print("a and b are equal")
if a is not c:
    print("a and c are not equal")
a="Sumit"
b="Sumit"
c=x

print(a is b)
print(a == b)
print( a is c)
type(c)
c="x"
print(c)
type(c)
print(a is b is not c)
a="10"
print(a)
type(a)
# Membership operator - used to check if a value is a member of a sequence (such as list, tuple)
# The two membership operators are 'in' and 'not in'


fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Chicku']
if 'Banana' in fruits:
    print("It Present")
if 'Orange' in fruits:
    print("Orange not in present")
a = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Chicku']
print('Banana' in a)
print("Orange" not in a)
